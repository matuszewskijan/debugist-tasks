Hey, here is list of emails of our employees `[support/email-list.txt]`.
We always used this simple script to create a CSV with first/last names and emails.
No idea why but the output for current list seems to be completely wrong.
Could you take a look to fix it? Don't hesistate to edit the list if there is something wrong with it's format.
