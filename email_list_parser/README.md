Hey, here is list of emails of our employees `[support/email-list-new.txt]`.
We always used this simple script to create a CSV with first/last names and emails.
No idea why but the output for current list seems to be completely wrong.
Could you take a look to fix it?

I am also sending old list which were working great(`[support/email-list-old.txt]`), the code should parse both old and new lists.
